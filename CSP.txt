Week 9: Search and Constraint
Satisfaction Problems

What is Search?
◆

Search is not about prediction but about choice and decisionmaking, such as planning and assigning. Examples: path-finding
(Google map), taking next move in games (Chess, Go), and task
assigning (Uber taxi).

◆

Search techniques are universal problem-solving methods.

Search is a computational problem where the goal is to
find a solution, often a sequence of actions or a state, that
transforms an initial state into a goal state, by exploring a
space of possible solutions.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems:
A formal representation language
of a large class of search problems

Search Problems
◆

Search is the process of navigating from the start state to a goal
state by transitioning through intermediate states.

◆

A search problem consists of
◆
◆
◆
◆
◆

◆

State space: all possible states.
Start state: where the agent begins the search.
Goal state: the desired state that the agent is looking for.
Goal test: whether the goal state is achieved or not.
A successor function (also called transition function, often associated
with a cost): given a certain state, what actions are available and for
those actions what are the next stage the agent will land into.

A solution is a sequence of actions which transforms the start
state to a goal state.

State Space Graph and Search Tree
◆

State space graph: a mathematical
representation of a search problem.
◆
◆

◆

A

Nodes represent states.
Arcs represent transitions.

A search tree: the process of solving the search
problem can be abstracted as a search tree.
◆

◆
◆

C

S

The start state is the root node.
Children correspond to successors.
Nodes show states, but correspond to plans (i.e.,
paths) that achieve those states.

Generic tree search
function Tree-Search (problem, strategy) returns a solution, or failure
initialise the search tree via setting the start state of problem as root node and put
it in Frontier
loop do
if there are no nodes in Frontier for expansion then return failure
else choose a node in Frontier for expansion according to strategy and
remove it from Frontier
if the chosen node is a goal state then return the corresponding solution
else expand the node based on problem and add the resulting nodes to Frontier
end

◆

Frontier: to store the nodes waiting for expansion.

◆

Expansion: to find and display the children of the node.

◆

Expansion strategy: to decide which node in Frontier to expand
(like depth first search), also called to explore.

following search problem

Nodes in circle mean those in the search
tree, including the expanded ones (shaded)
or to be expanded (i.e. in the frontier).

This is a sample document.
It has multiple lines.
We will chunk and embed it.
Chunking is useful for large texts.
Embeddings help find similar pieces of text.
